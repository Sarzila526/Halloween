# Halloween
openGL graphics

This computer graphics project is based on Halloween theme. There is a haunted house surrounded by dancing ghosts and pumpkins, some graves, and a rotating ghost hand. A starry sky is seen, with a large moon, and some bats are flying around the moon and the house. A river with a ghost ship, and a flying witch in the sky with her broomstick. This project looks childish, but my course teacher liked it because of the creativity.
